# Graduation-Project
In my graduation project, I focused on the frontend development and created various pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for Reddit. Specifically, I worked on three main pages:

Admin Page: I designed and implemented an admin page that allows administrators to manage and moderate the platform efficiently. This page provides essential tools for handling user accounts, content moderation, and site settings.

Buying and Selling Page: To enhance the functionality of Reddit, I developed a dedicated buying and selling page. Users can use this page to post items for sale, browse available products, and engage in transactions with other users in a secure and user-friendly environment.

User Profile Page: I also crafted a personalized user profile page that users can customize to showcase their interests, activities, and contributions on Reddit. The profile page displays relevant user information, their posts, comments, and overall engagement on the platform.

Throughout the project, I ensured the design was responsive and compatible with various devices, providing a seamless user experience. By utilizing Bootstrap, I enhanced the overall aesthetics and responsiveness of the pages, making them visually appealing and easy to navigate.

My aim was to contribute to Reddit's frontend development, offering an improved user experience and enhancing the platform's capabilities. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap allowed me to create dynamic, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing web pages for Reddit, empowering users and administrators alike.
